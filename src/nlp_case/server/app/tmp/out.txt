ASYMPTOTIC PROPERTIES OF GENERALIZED

EIGENFUNCTIONS FOR MULTI-DIMENSIONAL QUANTUM

WALKS

TAKASHI KOMATSU, NORIO KONNO, HISASHI MORIOKA, AND ETSUO SEGAWA

Abstract. We construct a distorted Fourier transformation associated with
the multi-dimensional quantum walk. In order to avoid the complication of no-
tations, almost all of our arguments are restricted to two dimensional quantum
walks (2DQWs) without loss of generality. The distorted Fourier transforma-
tion characterizes generalized eigenfunctions of the time evolution operator of
the QW. The 2DQW which will be considered in this paper has an anisotropy
due to the deﬁnition of the shift operator for the free QW. Then we deﬁne
an anisotropic Banach space as a modiﬁed Agmon-H¨ormander’s B∗ space and
we derive the asymptotic behavior at inﬁnity of generalized eigenfunctions in
these spaces. The scattering matrix appears in the asymptotic expansion of
generalized eigenfunctions.

1. Introduction

1.1. Scattering theory for multi-dimensional quantum walk. In this paper,
we consider the time-independent scattering theory for the position-dependent d-
dimensional quantum walk (dDQW or simply QW for short) as a ﬁnite rank pertur-
bation of the dD free QW which is deﬁned as follows. The states of quantum walker
on Zd = {x = (x1, . . . , xd) ; x1, . . . , xd ∈ Z} are represented by ψ = {ψ(x)}x∈Zd
which are C2d-valued sequences. Letting ∗T be the transpose operator for matrices
or vectors, we denote by the column vector
1 (x), . . . , ψ+

ψ(x) = [ψ+
for C-valued sequences ψ±
j (x) corre-
sponds the “probability amplitude” at x ∈ Zd of the chirality (j,±). The dD free
QW is deﬁned by the operator U0 = S where S is the shift operator :

where e1, . . . , ed are the standard basis on Zd. The position-dependent QW is
deﬁned by the operator U = SC where C is the operator of multiplication by a
k,l=1 ∈ U(2d) for every x ∈ Zd. Throughout of this paper,
matrix C(x) = (ck,l(x))2d
we assume that the following statements hold.

• There exists a positive integer n0 such that C(x) is the 2d × 2d identity
matrix I2d for x ∈ Zd \ D where D = {x ∈ Zd ; |x1| ≤ n0, . . . , |xd| ≤ n0}.
• For every x ∈ D,

det(c2k−1,2l−1(x))d

k,l=1,

det(c2k,2l(x))d

k,l=1,

do not vanish.

These assumptions will be used in order to prove a unique continuation property for
generalized eigenfunctions of U in Lemma 3.7 and Corollary 3.8. The unique con-
tinuation property guarantees a radiation condition for non-homogeneous equations
and the absence of eigenvalues of U . See Corollaries 3.11 and 3.12.

In the following, almost all of our arguments are restricted to the case d = 2 in
order to avoid the complication of notations. Our results can be generalized easily
for higher dimensional cases. For the case d = 2, we use more explicit notations.
Components of C4-valued sequences ψ are written as

ψ(x) = [ψ←(x), ψ→(x), ψ↓(x), ψ↑(x)]T,

x ∈ Z2.

The chirality of ψ is represented by p ∈ {←,→,↓,↑}. Typical examples of C(x) for
every x ∈ D such that the second assumption holds are

Obviously, operators U0 and U are unitary on the Hilbert space (cid:96)2 := (cid:96)2(Z2; C4)

equipped with the standard inner product

(f, g)(cid:96)2 =

fp(x)gp(x).

p∈{←,→,↓,↑}

x∈Z2

The discrete time evolutions of these QWs are given by

Ψ(t,·) = U tψ, Ψ(0)(t,·) = U t

0ψ,

t ∈ Z,

for an initial state ψ. If ψ ∈ (cid:96)2, these time evolutions preserve the (cid:96)2-norm of ψ i.e.
(cid:107)Ψ(t,·)(cid:107)(cid:96)2 = (cid:107)Ψ(0)(t,·)(cid:107)(cid:96)2 = (cid:107)ψ(cid:107)(cid:96)2 for any t ∈ Z.

In view of the quantum scattering theory, the scattering matrix (S-matrix) is an
important object. There are several equivalent deﬁnitions of the S-matrix. In the
time-dependent scattering theory, we can prove that the wave operators

W± = s-lim

t→±∞ U−tU t

0

in (cid:96)2

exist and asymptotically complete under our assumption by the similar way of
Suzuki [21]. Namely, we have the following fact on the long time behavior of QWs.
See also Figure 1.

Figure 1. For an initial state φ ∈ Hac(U ), there exist ψ± ∈ (cid:96)2
such that U tφ ∼ U t
0ψ± as t → ±∞. The wave operators represent
these asymptotic behaviors. Roughly speaking, the scattering in
0ψ−
view of the dynamics of U tφ is a transition from a free QW U t
0ψ+. The scattering operator Σ relates ψ−
to another free QW U t
and ψ+.

Proposition 1.1. The ranges of the wave operators coincide with Hac(U ), the
absolutely continuous subspace for U . In particular, for any φ ∈ Hac(U ), there
exist ψ± ∈ (cid:96)2 such that (cid:107)U tφ − U t
0ψ±(cid:107)(cid:96)2 → 0 as t → ±∞. The wave operators are
unitary on (cid:96)2 and we have W ∗

± = W −1± .

The scattering operator Σ = W ∗

Note that this proposition holds under the short-range condition. Namely, the
ﬁrst assumption for C(x) can be replaced by (cid:107)C(x)− I4(cid:107) ≤ c(1 +|x|)−1− for some
constants c,  > 0 for Proposition 1.1.
+W− : ψ− (cid:55)→ ψ+ is another important object. In
view of Proposition 1.1, Σ connects the behavior of the quantum walker as t → −∞
quantum walker ψ− to another free quantum walker ψ+. The S-matrix (cid:98)Σ(θ) for
to t → ∞ in terms of the 2D free QW i.e. Σ represents a transition from the 2D free
θ ∈ [0, 2π) is given by the spectral decomposition of(cid:98)Σ which is a spectral transform

of Σ which will be introduced in the formula (4.18) as

(cid:98)Σ =

(cid:90) 2π

0

⊕(cid:98)Σ(θ)dθ.

For details of the time-dependent scattering theory for QWs, see Suzuki [21] or
Morioka [15].
In these previous works, the authors consider 1DQWs. However,
their arguments rely on abstract operator theory and spectral theory for unitary
operators. Then it can be applied for our case easily.

The wave operators and the scattering operator are considered in the Hilbert
space (cid:96)2. From the physical point of view, it is reasonable to consider plane waves
and corresponding scattered waves in certain classes larger than (cid:96)2. Moreover,
the S-matrix naturally appears in a spatial asymptotic behavior at inﬁnity of a
generalized eigenfunction to the equation

(U − eiθ)u = 0

on Z2,

θ ∈ [0, 2π).

In view of the separation of variables Ψ(t, x) = eitθu(x) where u satisﬁes the above
equation, we have a time evolution Ψ(t,·) = U tu for any t ∈ Z. Note that gen-
eralized eigenfunctions do not belong to (cid:96)2 when eiθ is included in the continuous
spectrum of U . Generalized eigenfunctions associated with a continuous spectrum
consist of an incident plane wave and the corresponding scattered wave. The S-
matrix appears in the scattered wave as its amplitude and phase shift. See Figure
2. Thus the spectral theory for U is an important topic in the research area of the
scattering theory for QWs.

T. KOMATSU, N. KONNO, H. MORIOKA, AND E. SEGAWA

The main purpose of this paper is to construct and to characterize generalized
eigenfunctions in an anisotropic Banach space on Z2. The spectral theory for the
unitary operator U allows us to see the behavior of the outgoing scattered wave. In
order to study the distorted Fourier transformation, we often use the Green function
which is the kernel of the resolvent operator R0(κ) = (U0 − eiκ)−1, κ ∈ C \ R. If
κ ∈ R, the operator R0(κ) does not make sense in (cid:96)2. However, we will show that
the limit R0(θ ± i0) for θ ∈ R exists in the sense of Agmon-H¨ormander’s B-B∗
spaces ([1]).
1.2. Agmon-H¨ormander’s spaces. Agmon-H¨ormander’s B-B∗ spaces are often
used in the time-independent scattering theory for Schr¨odinger equations. Consider
the equation

(−∆ + V − λ)u = 0

on Rd,

λ > 0,

where V ∈ C∞
characterized by the Banach space B∗ equipped with the norm

0 (Rd) is a real-valued function. The solution to this equation can be

The solution u has the asymptotics

(cid:17)

as |x| → ∞ where ω = x/|x|. It is well-known that the S-matrix for Schr¨odinger
operators relates φ+ and φ−. For this topic, see Yafaev [25].

For our 2DQW, it is inadequate to adopt the usual separation of variables and
to derive the asymptotic expansion with respect to the radius due to anisotropy of
U and U0. Then we introduce a pair of anisotropic B-B∗ spaces. We will derive
the asymptotic behaviors of generalized eigenfunctions by evaluating functions for
each direction depending on its chirality.

Figure 2. The notion of the scattering in view of generalized
eigenfunctions associated with the continuous spectrum. For
Schr¨odinger equations (−∆ + V (x))u = λu or acoustic wave equa-
tions −c(x)2∆u = λu on Rd, the scattered wave is a spherical
wave up to lower order terms (Left ﬁgure). However, for QWs on
Zd, spherical waves do not appear, and the scattered wave passes
along corridors (Right ﬁgure). Entries of the S-matrix appear in
the scattered wave as its amplitude and phase shift.

1.3. Related works. The scattering theory for one dimensional QWs has been
studied in some previous works. Feldman-Hillery [5, 6] are pioneering studies
of QWs in view of the scattering theory. As has been mentioned above, Suzuki
[21] proved the existence and the asymptotic completeness of the wave operators.
Richard et al.
[18, 19] considered more general cases. Note that the authors
adopted commutator method for unitary operators (see [2], [7], [20]). Morioka
[15], Morioka-Segawa [16], Maeda et al.
[12] considered
the time-independent scattering theory and the absence of eigenvalues embedded
in the continuous spectrum. Tiedra de Aldecoa [23] studied an abstract theory
of time-independent scattering for unitary operators and its applications to QWs.
Maeda et al. [13] solved an inverse scattering problem for a nonlinear QW.

[14] and Komatsu et al.

Our method adopted in this paper is an analogue of the time-independent scat-
tering theory for self-adjoint Hamiltonians. Over the past few years, the time-
independent scattering theory for discrete Schr¨odinger operators has been studied.
The following works are deeply related with our arguments: Isozaki-Korotyaev [9],
Isozaki-Morioka [10, 11], Ando et al. [3, 4]. Nakamura [17] constructed the S-matrix
as a pseudo-diﬀerential operator for discrete Schr¨odinger operators (as one of ex-
amples of applications) by using the microlocal analysis. Tadano [22] studied the
scattering theory for discrete Schr¨odinger operators with long-range perturbations.

1.4. Results and plan of this paper. In Section 2, we introduce some functional
spaces. The anisotropic B-B∗ spaces are deﬁned here. Some properties of these
functional spaces will be proven.

In Section 3, we study some properties of the Green function associated with
the 2D free QW. By using the Green function of the 1D free QW, we can derive
an explicit formula of the Green function of the 2D free QW. Then we can see
the asymptotic behavior of the solution in B∗ to the equation (U0 − eiθ)u = f for
f ∈ B. In view of this asymptotics, we can deﬁne the radiation condition which
guarantees the uniqueness of the solution to the equation (U0 − eiθ)u = f . Here we
apply a multi-dimensional generalization of the unique continuation property for
QWs (Corollary 3.8). As a consequence of the argument in Section 3, we have the
absence of eigenvalues of U (Corollary 3.12).
In Section 4, we consider the generalized eigenfunction for U . We introduce a
combinatorial construction of generalized eigenfunctions in B∗. This construction
is a multi-dimensional version of the result in [12]. This approach is based on the
long time limit of the dynamics of QWs. After that, we discuss the spectral theory
for U in order to characterize rigorously the set of generalized eigenfunctions in
B∗. The existence of the limits R(θ ± i0) in B-B∗ spaces for R(κ) = (U − eiκ)−1 is
proved here. The spectral representation of U is introduced as a distorted Fourier
transformation associated with U . Due to the closed range theorem, we prove
a characterization of generalized eigenfunctions in B∗ (Theorem 4.15). Finally,

we show that the S-matrix (cid:98)Σ(θ) naturally appears in the asymptotic behavior of

generalized eigenfunctions. We observe that the scattered wave does not spread
radially but passes along some corridors (Theorem 4.20).

1.5. Notation. The notation used throughout of this paper is as follows. T2 :=
R2/(2πZ2) denotes the ﬂat torus. For u, v ∈ Cn, (cid:104)u, v(cid:105) denotes the inner product of

Cn, and we put |u| =(cid:112)(cid:104)u, u(cid:105). For a matrix A, A∗ denotes the Hermitian conjugate

AT. diag[a1, . . . , an] denotes the n × n diagonal matrix.

For Banach spaces X and Y , B(X; Y ) denotes the set of bounded linear operators
from X to Y . For an operator L ∈ B((cid:96)2; (cid:96)2), L∗ is the adjoint operator of L with
respect to the inner product of (cid:96)2. As usual, for an operator L ∈ B(X; Y ) for
Banach spaces X and Y , L∗ is its adjoint operator in B(Y ∗; X∗). However, for
U = SC and U0 = S, we often adopt the abuse of notations U∗ = C∗S−1 and
U∗
0 = S−1 on some Banach spaces.

2.2. Some properties. The following inclusion relation holds.

Lemma 2.3. We have

3. Radiation condition

3.1. Continuous spectrum. The classiﬁcation of the spectrum of a unitary oper-
ator is a consequence of the spectral theory for self-adjoint operators (see e.g. [24]).
In the following, σ(A) is the totality of the spectrum of A. There are two kinds of
classiﬁcation of σ(A). One is based on the spectral measure of A. Namely, there
exists a spectral decomposition EA(θ) for θ ∈ R such that A can be represented by

(cid:90) 2π

0

A =

eiθdEA(θ),

where EA(θ) = 0 for θ < 0 and EA(θ) = 1 for θ ≥ 2π. Since EA(θ) is a measure on
R, it provides a orthogonal decomposition of H as

H = Hp(A) ⊕ Hac(A) ⊕ Hsc(A),

where Hp(A) is the closure of the subspace spanned by eigenfunctions in H of
A, Hac(A) and Hsc(A) are orthogonal projections onto the absolutely continuous
subspace and the singular continuous subspace with respect to the measure EA(θ),
respectively. Then the spectrum σ(A) is classiﬁed as

σp(A) = {eigenvalues of A},

σac(A) = σ(A|Hac ),

σsc(A) = σ(A|Hsc ).

We call them the point spectrum, the absolutely continuous spectrum, and the
singular continuous spectrum, respectively.

Another classiﬁcation of σ(A) is based on the topological point of view. The
discrete spectrum σd(A) is the set of isolated eigenvalues of A with ﬁnite multi-
plicities. The essential spectrum σess(A) is deﬁned by σess(A) = σ(A) \ σd(A) i.e.
σess(A) is the set of accumulation points in σ(A). Note that eigenvalues of inﬁnite
multiplicity are included in σess(A).
For the spectral theory for 2DQWs, we take H = (cid:96)2 and A = U0 or U . First of
all, let us derive the structure of σ(U0) explicitly. In order to do this, we consider

(cid:98)U0 = UU0U∗ which is the operator of multiplication by the unitary matrix

(cid:98)U0(ξ) = diag[eiξ1 , e−iξ1, eiξ2, e−iξ2],

ξ ∈ T2.

Obviously, we have

p(ξ; κ) := det((cid:98)U0(ξ) − eiκ) =

2(cid:89)

for κ ∈ C. Then we obtain the spectrum σ(U0).

Lemma 3.1. We have σ(U0) = σess(U0) = σac(U0) = {eiθ ; θ ∈ [0, 2π)}.

Proof. Due to the formula of p(ξ, κ), σp(U0) = ∅ is trivial. Let R0(κ) = (U0 −

(3.1)
for a < b and κ,± = θ − i log(1 ∓ ). For the proof of (3.1), see [15, Lemma 4.5].
Since we have

f ∈ (cid:96)2,

we can obtain

(EU0 ((a, b))f, f )(cid:96)2 =

which can be proved by the complex contour integration in the similar way of [15,
Appendix A] or [12, Appendix A]. Then the spectral measure EU0(θ) is absolutely
(cid:3)
continuous.

As a consequence of Weyl’s singular sequence method, we also determine σess(U )

since U − U0 is compact in (cid:96)2.
Lemma 3.2. We have σess(U ) = σess(U0) = {eiθ ; θ ∈ [0, 2π)}. As a consequence,
we have σd(U ) = ∅.

Proof. A rigorous proof was given in [16, Lemma 2.1] which is an analogue
of well-known Weyl’s singular sequence method on preservation of the essential
(cid:3)
spectrum for self-adjoint operators (See e.g. [24, Section 0.3]).

3.2. Green function and resolvent operator. The resolvent operators

R0(κ) = (U0 − eiκ)−1, R(κ) = (U − eiκ)−1,

do not make sense as operators in B((cid:96)2; (cid:96)2) when eiκ ∈ σ(U0) or σ(U ). The limiting
absorption principle ensure the existence of the limits R0(θ ± i0) = lim↓0 R0(θ −
i log(1 ∓ )) and R(θ ± i0) = lim↓0 R(θ − i log(1 ∓ )) in B(B;B∗) for θ ∈ [0, 2π).
Here we consider R0(θ ± i0) by using an explicit formula of the Green function.

Now we seek a solution to the equation

(3.2)
for κ ∈ C \ R such that u is given by

(U0 − eiκ)u = f,

f ∈ B,

u(x) =

G0(x − y; κ)f (y),

where the kernel G0(x; κ) is a diagonal matrix

G0(x; κ) = diag[r←(x; κ), r→(x; κ), r↓(x; κ), r↑(x; κ)].

Passing through the Fourier transformation, we can see easily the following lemma.
Lemma 3.3. Let δ = {δx0}x∈Z2 where δxy is the Kronecker delta for x, y ∈ Z2.
The kernel G0(x; κ) is the fundamental solution to the equation (3.2) in the sense

for κ ∈ C \ R. In particular, we have (R0(κ)f )(x) =(cid:80)

(U0 − eiκ)G0(·; κ) = diag[δ, δ, δ, δ],

f ∈ B.

Let us compute G0(x; κ) explicitly as follows. We have

r←(x; κ) =

Even if we take limits of (3.7)-(3.14) as  ↓ 0 in the weak ∗ sense, the formulas

Note that the summations on the right-hand side of (3.15)-(3.16) converge due to
Lemma 2.4. Then we obtain the limiting absorption principle for R0(κ).

Lemma 3.5. Let J be an arbitrary compact interval in [0, 2π).

(1) For θ ∈ [0, 2π), we have R0(θ ± i0) ∈ B(B;B∗) in the weak ∗ topology. In
particular, there exists a constant c > 0 such that (cid:107)R0(θ± i0)f(cid:107)B∗ ≤ c(cid:107)f(cid:107)B
where θ varies on J.

(2) The mapping J (cid:51) θ (cid:55)→ (R0(θ ± i0)f, g) for f, g ∈ B is continuous.

We can see the asymptotic behavior of R0(θ ± i0)f at inﬁnity from formulas

(3.15)-(3.16).

(R0(θ + i0)f )(x) − (I1,+(x) + I1,−(x) + I2,+(x) + I2,−(x))

Thus (R0(θ + i0)f )(x)− (I1,+(x) + I1,−(x) + I2,+(x) + I2,−(x)) vanishes except for a
ﬁnite number of x ∈ Z2. This implies the formula (3.17). For any f ∈ B and  > 0,
there exists g ∈ B such that g has a ﬁnite support and satisﬁes (cid:107)f − g(cid:107)B < . Then
the formula (3.17) holds for any f ∈ B due to Lemma 3.5. The proof of (3.18) is
(cid:3)
similar.

3.3. Multi-dimensional unique continuation for QW. In this subsection, we
consider the unique continuation property for generalized eigenfunctions of dDQWs
as follows.

Lemma 3.7. Suppose that a C2d-valued sequence ψ on Zd satisﬁes the equation
(U −eiθ)ψ = 0. For any x ∈ Zd, the value ψ(x) is determined uniquely by ψ(x+ej),
j = 1, . . . , d.

Proof. The unique continuation property for 1DQW is well-known since (U −
eiθ)ψ = 0 on Z can be reduced to a ﬁrst order recurrence formula. Let us prove
the lemma for d ≥ 2. We put

C(x) = ((cid:126)cj(x))2d

j=1,

x ∈ Zd,

where (cid:126)cj(x) are row vectors of C(x). In the proof of this lemma, we use the similar
notation for row vectors of some matrices. We also deﬁne matrices A(k)
θ (x) =

In view of the assumption for C(x), we have

from ψ(cid:12)(cid:12)ON (x). In particular, if ψ = 0 in ON (x), we have ψ(x) = 0.

j=1(yj −
xj) = N} for x ∈ Zd and a positive integer N . If the solution ψ to the equation
(U −eiθ)ψ = 0 is known in the subset ON (x), the value ψ(x) is determined uniquely

3.4. Radiation condition. Lemma 3.6 implies the radiation condition which guar-
antees the uniqueness of solutions to the equation (U − eiθ)u = f for f ∈ B. In
view of the anisotropy of the asymptotic behavior of R0(θ ± i0)f , we deﬁne the
radiation condition as follows.

Let us introduce the operator

(B±f )(x) = [F (±x1)f←(x), F (∓x1)f→(x), F (±x2)f↓(x), F (∓x2)f↑(x)]T,

for x ∈ Z2.
Deﬁnition 3.9. The solutions u(±) ∈ B∗ to the equation (U − eiθ)u(±) = f for
f ∈ B are incoming (for +) or outgoing (for −) if u(±) satisfy
(3.19)

B±Su(±) − eiθu(±) ∈ B∗
0.

Lemma 3.10. Suppose that u(±) ∈ B∗ satisfy the equation (U − eiθ)u(±) = 0 and
the condition (3.19). Then we have u(±) = 0.

Proof. We prove for u(+) and the proof for u(−) is similar. Due to the equation
(U − eiθ)u(+) = 0, u(+)← satisﬁes u(+)← (x + e1) = eiθu(+)← (x) for x ∈ Z2 \ D with
x1 ≤ −n0−2 or |x2| ≥ n0 +1. In particular, we have |u(+)← (x+e1)| = |u(+)← (x)|. This
equality and the radiation condition (3.19) imply lim inf x1→−∞ |u←(x1, x2)| = 0 for
every x2. Then we have

(3.20)

u(+)← (x) = 0

in D+← = {x ∈ Z2 ; x1 ≤ −n0 − 1 or |x2| ≥ n0 + 1}.

By (3.20)-(3.23) and the deﬁnition of the operator U = SC, we have
Due to the equation (U − eiθ)u(+) = 0, we also have (cid:80)
(cid:80)
x∈D∪∂D |u(+)(x)|2. Thus (3.24) can be rewritten as

Since C(x) is unitary, we have |C(x)u(+)(x)|2 = |u(+)(x)|2 for every x ∈ D.

This implies u(+)← (n0+2, x2) = u(+)→ (−n0−2, x2) = 0 for |x2| ≤ n0, and u(+)↓

(x1,−n0 − 2) = 0 for |x1| ≤ n0. By using the equation (U − eiθ)u(+) = 0
2) = u(+)↑
in the region Z2 \ D, we obtain u(+) = 0 in Z2 \ D. Due to Corollary 3.8, u(+) = 0
(cid:3)
is extended in D.

As a direct consequence of this lemma, we can show immediately the uniqueness
of the incoming (for +) or outgoing (for −) solution to the equation (U0− eiθ)u = f
for f ∈ B.
Corollary 3.11. The solution u(±) ∈ B∗ to the equation (U0 − eiθ)u(±) = f for
f ∈ B is incoming (for +) or outgoing (for −) if and only if u(±) = R0(θ ± i0)f .
Proof. R0(θ ± i0)f obviously satisfy the radiation condition (3.19) in view of
Lemma 3.6. For the proof of uniqueness, we assume that the solutions v(±) ∈ B∗
to the equation (U0 − eiθ)v(±) = f are incoming (for +) or outgoing (for −). Thus
w(±) = R0(θ± i0)f − v(±) satisfy the equation (U0− eiθ)w(±) = 0 and the condition
(cid:3)
(3.19). Lemma 3.10 implies w(±) = 0.

We also have the absence of eigenvalues of U .

Corollary 3.12. We have σp(U ) = ∅.

Proof. Recall that σess(U ) = {eiθ ; θ ∈ [0, 2π)}. Then σp(U ) ⊂ σess(U ). If
there exists an eigenvalue eiθ, the corresponding eigenfunction ψ ∈ (cid:96)2 satisﬁes the
equation (U − eiθ)ψ = 0 and the condition (3.19). Lemma 3.10 implies ψ = 0. This
(cid:3)
is a contradiction.

GENERALIZED EIGENFUNCTIONS FOR MULTI-DIM. QWS

4. Generalized eigenfunction

4.1. Combinatorial construction of generalized eigenfunction. Before we
derive the spectral theory for U , we mention a combinatorial construction of gen-
eralized eigenfunctions. This construction is based on a long time behavior of a
dynamics of the QW. Our argument in this subsection is an analogue of [12] which
is a special case of [8, Theorem 3.1].
Let χ : B∗ → (cid:96)2(D; C4) be deﬁned by (χu)(x) = u(x) for x ∈ D. We also
introduce the operator χ∗ : (cid:96)2(D; C4) → B∗ by (χ∗ψ)(x) = ψ(x) for x ∈ D and
(χ∗ψ)(x) = 0 for x ∈ Z2 \ D. We deﬁne the 4(2n0 + 1)2 × 4(2n0 + 1)2 submatrix

UD = χU χ∗.

Fixing a basis of (cid:96)2(D; C4) = C4(2n0+1)2
of the matrix UD. In this paper, we omit it.
Lemma 4.1. Eigenvalues of UD lie in the subset {λ ∈ C ; |λ| < 1}.

, we can obtain an explicit representation

Proof. For an eigenvector ψ ∈ (cid:96)2(D; C4) associated with an eigenvalue λ, we

have

|λ|2(cid:107)ψ(cid:107)2

(cid:96)2(D;C4) = (cid:107)UDψ(cid:107)2

(cid:96)2(D;C4) ≤ (cid:107)U χ∗ψ(cid:107)2

(cid:96)2(Z2;C4) = (cid:107)ψ(cid:107)2

(cid:96)2(D;C4).

This implies |λ| ≤ 1. Now we suppose |λ| = 1. This implies (cid:107)UDψ(cid:107)2
(cid:107)U χ∗ψ(cid:107)2
Thus we obtain

(cid:96)2(D;C4) =
(cid:96)2(Z2;C4). In view of the deﬁnition of χ and χ∗, we have (1−χ∗χ)U χ∗ψ = 0.

U χ∗ψ = χ∗χU χ∗ψ = λχ∗ψ,

and χ∗ψ is an eigenfunction of U with a ﬁnite support. It follows χ∗ψ = 0 from
(cid:3)
Corollary 3.12. This is a contradiction.

in view of the Jordan canonical form of UD. Namely, there exists a 4(2n0 + 1)2 ×
4(2n0 + 1)2 regular matrix G such that

G−1UDG = J(λ1, k1) ⊕ ··· ⊕ J(λr, kr),

for a positive integer r where J(λj, kj) is the Jordan block for an eigenvalue λj with
algebraic multiplicity kj.

Now let us derive a construction of a generalized eigenfunction of U with a
single incident wave along an incoming path. Note that a generalized eigenfunction
of U with multiple incident waves can be written by a linear combination of the
generalized eigenfunctions associated with a single incident wave.
Lemma 4.2. Take an integer b ∈ [−n0, n0]. Let Ψ0 ∈ B∗ be given by

Ψ0(x) =

eiθx1e←,
0,

x = (x1, b),
otherwise,

x1 ≥ n0 + 1,

for θ ∈ [0, 2π). We deﬁne Ψt for every positive integer t by Ψt = U Ψt−1. Then
there exists a limint

Ψ∞(x) := lim

t→∞ e−itθΨt(x),

x ∈ Z2,

18

T. KOMATSU, N. KONNO, H. MORIOKA, AND E. SEGAWA

and Ψ∞ ∈ B∗ satisﬁes U Ψ∞ = eiθΨ∞ on Z2.

Proof. The initial state Ψ0 is an incoming ﬂow on (x1, b) for x1 ≥ n0 + 1. The
outgoing ﬂow occurs due to the perturbation in the region D. Once the ﬂow comes
out of D, it goes away. In view of this dynamics, we split Ψt into three parts

Ψt = χ∗χΨt + (1 − χ∗χ)(Ψt − eitθΨ0) + eitθ(1 − χ∗χ)Ψ0.

The ﬁrst term on the right-hand side is the state in D. The second and third term
on the right-hand side are the outgoing ﬂow and the incoming ﬂow on Z2 \ D,
respectively.

Letting φt = χΨt, we have

φ0 = 0, φt+1 = UDφt + eitθχU Ψ0,

t ≥ 0,

where we have used the equality χU (1 − χ∗χ)U tΨ0 = eitθχU Ψ0. The solution of
this recurrence formula is

φt = eiθ(t−1)

In view of Lemma 4.1, the limit

φ∞ := lim

t→∞ e−itθφt = e−iθ(1 − e−iθE)−1χU Ψ0

exists and obtain the equation

(4.1)

UDφ∞ + χU Ψ0 = eiθφ∞.

t−1(cid:88)

m=1

Let us derive the outgoing ﬂow. We deﬁne the subset

B = {x ∈ D ; |x1| = n0 or |x2| = n0}.

Let δB be the characteristic function of the subset B. The outgoing ﬂow for t ≥ 2
is given by

(1 − χ∗χ)(Ψt − eitθΨ0) = (1 − χ∗χ)

U mft−m,

where the source ft−m is deﬁned by ft−m = δBχ∗φt−m. For t ≥ 2, the value of the
outgoing ﬂow Ψt,out := (1 − χ∗χ)(Ψt − eitθΨ0) at every point x ∈ Z2 \ D is
|x1| > n0, |x2| ≤ n0,
|x1| ≤ n0, |x2| > n0 + 1,

Ψt,out(x1, x2) = (U µx1 ft−µx1

Ψt,out(x1, x2) = (U µx2 ft−µx2

)(x1, x2)

for

for

or Ψt,out(x) = 0 for other x ∈ Z2 \ D where

(cid:26) x1 − n0, x1 ≥ n0 + 1,

µx1 =

−x1 − n0, x1 ≤ −n0 − 1,

µx2 =

(cid:26) x2 − n0, x2 ≥ n0 + 1,

−x2 − n0, x2 ≤ −n0 − 1.

Then the limit Ψout := limt→∞ e−itθ(1 − χ∗χ)(Ψt − eitθΨ0) is given by

t→∞ e−itθ(U µx ft−µx )(x) = e−iµxθ(U f∞)((cid:101)x),

for f∞ = δBχ∗φ∞, µx = µx1 or µx2, and(cid:101)x = (±(n0 + 1), x2) or (x1,±(n0 + 1)).

Ψout(x) = lim

Finally, we show the equation U Ψ∞ = eiθΨ∞. Note that
on Z2.

Ψ∞ = χ∗φ∞ + Ψout + Ψ0

Then we have

(4.2)

χ∗χU Ψ∞ = χ∗UDφ∞ + χ∗χU Ψ0 + χ∗χU Ψout = eiθχ∗φ∞,

GENERALIZED EIGENFUNCTIONS FOR MULTI-DIM. QWS

in view of (4.1) and χU Ψout = 0. We also have

(1 − χ∗χ)U Ψ∞ = (1 − χ∗χ)U (χ∗φ∞ + Ψ0) + U Ψout

(4.3)

= (1 − χ∗χ)δ∂DU f∞ + eiθΨ0 + eiθΨout − δ∂DU f∞
= eiθ(Ψout + Ψ0),

where δ∂D is the characteristic function of the subset ∂D (see the proof of Lemma
3.10 for the deﬁnition of ∂D). Plugging (4.2) and (4.3), we obtain the equation
(cid:3)
U Ψ∞ = eiθΨ∞.

Remark. For 1DQWs, a combinatorial formula of the S-matrix was derived by
[12] which is based on counting paths of quantum walkers in an interval on which
U (cid:54)= U0. For multi-dimensional cases, this approach is more complicated. However,
as has been derived in Lemma 4.1, we can construct generalized eigenfunctions as
a long time limit of a dynamics of QWs.

4.2. Limiting absorption principle for position-dependent QW. We have
proved the existence and a construction of generalized eigenfunctions in B∗. In the
following, we discuss the spectral theory for the operator U in order to characterize
rigorously the set of generalized eigenfunctions in B∗. By using the distorted Fourier
transformation associated with U , we can see that the S-matrix appears in the
outgoing scattered wave Ψout.
Here we prove the existence of the limits R(θ ± i0) = lim↓0 R(θ − i log(1 ∓ ))
in B(B;B∗). In the following argument, we put
V = U − U0.
(4.4)

The well-known resolvent equations hold :

R(κ) = R0(κ) − R0(κ)V R(κ) = R0(κ) − R(κ)V R0(κ),

(4.5)
for κ ∈ C \ R. In fact, these equalities follow from

(U0 − eiκ)R(κ) = 1 − V R(κ),

(U − eiκ)R0(κ) = 1 + V R0(κ).

We often use the formula

R(κ)∗ = −eiκU R(κ),
(4.6)
which follows from R(κ)∗ = ((eiκ − U )e−iκU∗)−1.
Lemma 4.3. For θ ∈ [0, 2π), we have R(θ ± i0) = lim↓0 R(θ − i log(1 ∓ )) ∈
B(B;B∗) in the weak ∗ topology.

Proof. Let J be a compact interval in [0, 2π). Due to the resolvent equation

(4.5) and Lemma 3.5, there exists a constant c > 0 such that
(cid:107)R(κ)f(cid:107)B∗ ≤ c((cid:107)f(cid:107)B + (cid:107)V R(κ)f(cid:107)B),

(4.7)
for Re κ ∈ J and Im κ (cid:54)= 0.

First of all, let us prove that there exists a constant c > 0 such that

(4.8)

(cid:107)R(κ)f(cid:107)B∗ ≤ c(cid:107)f(cid:107)B, Re κ ∈ J,

Im κ (cid:54)= 0.

Suppose that this inequality does not hold. Without loss of generality, we can
take sequences {f j}∞
j=1 ⊂ C \ R such that (cid:107)R(κj)f j(cid:107)B∗ = 1,
(cid:107)f j(cid:107)B → 0 and κj → θ + i0 as j → ∞. We put uj = R(κj)f j. Since the range
of the operator V is a ﬁnite dimensional subspace of B, there exists a subsequence

j=1 ⊂ B and {κj}∞

20

T. KOMATSU, N. KONNO, H. MORIOKA, AND E. SEGAWA

k=1 such that V ujk converges in B. Now let V ujk converge to a sequence

{ujk}∞
g ∈ B. It follows from the resolvent equation (4.5) and Lemma 3.5 that

(cid:0)R0(κjk )f jk − R0(κjk )V ujk(cid:1) = −R0(θ + i0)g,

u := lim

k→∞ ujk = lim
k→∞

in the weak ∗ sense. Then u satisﬁes the equation (U − eiθ)u = 0 and u = −R0(θ +
i0)g for g ∈ B. Applying Lemma 3.10 and Corollary 3.11, we have u = 0. This is a
contradiction in view of (cid:107)ujk(cid:107)B∗ = 1 for all k.
Next we show the existence of the limit R(θ + i0) in B(B;B∗) in the weak ∗
sense. We consider a sequence {κj}∞
j=1 where κj = θ − i log(1∓ j) with j ↓ 0. For
f ∈ B, we put uj = R(κj)f . Due to the inequality (4.8), there exists a subsequence
{ujk}∞
k=1 such that V ujk converges a sequence g ∈ B as above. Then the limit
u := limk→∞ ujk ∈ B∗ exists in the weak ∗ sense in view of

(cid:0)R0(κjk )f − R0(κjk )V ujk(cid:1) = R0(θ + i0)f − R0(θ + i0)g.

u = lim
k→∞

The estimate

(cid:107)g − V u(cid:107)B ≤ (cid:107)g − V ujk(cid:107)B + (cid:107)V (cid:107)B(B∗;B)(cid:107)u − ujk(cid:107)B∗ ,

implies g = V u. Let us prove that uj itself converges to u in B∗. Assume that there
exists another subsequence {ujl}∞
l=1 such that liml→∞ ujl = v (cid:54)= u in the weak ∗
sense for v ∈ B∗. We have

v = R0(θ + i0)f − R0(θ + i0)V v,

as above. Then u− v satisﬁes (U − eiθ)(u− v) = 0 and u− v = −R0(θ + i0)V (u− v).
Applying Lemma 3.10 and Corollary 3.11, we obtain u = v. This is a contradiction.
For R(θ − i0), the proof is similar.
(cid:3)
Remark. The limiting absorption principle in the sense of B(B;B∗) was intro-
duced by [1] (for self-adjoint partial diﬀerential operators with simple characteris-
tics). The pair B-B∗ is optimal for which the limiting absorption principle holds.
We also mention [23] in which a rigorous proof of the limiting absorption principle
for unitary operators was given as a general theory on Hilbert spaces. Applying it
for our case, we can see R(θ ± i0) ∈ B((cid:96)2,s, (cid:96)2,−s) for any s > 1/2 as a direct conse-
quence. However, since we adopt the framework of B-B∗ argument, we decided to
rewrite a complete proof of our concrete argument for the sake of completeness of
the paper.

By the similar way, we can also prove the following lemma.

Lemma 4.4. Let J be a compact interval in [0, 2π). The mapping J (cid:51) θ (cid:55)→
(R(θ ± i0)f, g) for f, g ∈ B is continuous.

As a direct consequence of the resolvent equation (4.5) and Lemmas 3.5 and 4.3,
we obtain the uniqueness of the incoming (for +) or outgoing (for −) solution to
the equation (U − eiθ)u = f for f ∈ B.
Corollary 4.5. The solution u(±) ∈ B∗ to the equation (U −eiθ)u(±) = f for f ∈ B
is incoming (for +) or outgoing (for −) if and only if u(±) = R(θ ± i0)f .

4.3. Distorted Fourier transformation for QW. Here we introduce the spec-
tral representations for U0 and U . The spectral representations are (distorted)
Fourier transformations associated with U0 and U . Moreover, the generalized eigen-
functions are constructed by the spectral representations.

Let us turn to the distorted Fourier transformation associated with U . Due to

(R(θ + i0)f − R(θ − i0)f, g) = 2πe−iθ(F (±)(θ)f,F (±)(θ)g)h(θ),

Proof. Note that the equalities

R(θ − i log(1 − )) − R(θ − i log(1 + ))

(4.13)

= −2eiθR(θ − i log(1 − ))R(θ − i log(1 + ))
= −2eiθR(θ − i log(1 + ))R(θ − i log(1 − )),

for  > 0. It follows from the second equality and the resolvent equation (4.5) that

R(θ + i0) − R(θ − i0)
= (1 − R(θ − i0)V )(R0(θ + i0) − R0(θ − i0))(1 − V R(θ + i0)).

From Lemma 4.7, we have

In view of (4.6), we have R(θ − i0)∗ = −eiθU R(θ + i0). Plugging this equality,

V ∗U = −U∗
F (+)(θ). We have proven the lemma for F (+)(θ). For F (−)(θ), we can prove the
(cid:3)
lemma by the same way, by using the ﬁrst equality in (4.13).
By some direct computations, we can show that F (±)(θ)∗ ∈ B(h(θ);B∗) is an

eigenoperator of U as follows.
Lemma 4.11. For any φ ∈ h(θ), F (±)(θ)∗φ ∈ B∗ satisﬁes the equation (U −

in view of (4.6) and (U − eiθ)R(θ ± i0)g = g for any g ∈ B. Then we have
UF (±)(θ)∗ = eiθF (±)(θ)∗ by using the equalities U V ∗ = −V U∗
0F (0)(θ)∗ =
e−iθF (0)(θ)∗.
The formula (4.14) implies that F (±)(θ)∗φ − F (0)(θ)∗φ is outgoing (for +) or
incoming (for −) in view of Lemma 4.9 and the fact that V ∗F (0)(θ)∗φ = 0 at
(cid:3)

4.4. Characterization of generalized eigenfunction. The set of solutions to

Now we can prove the characterization of solutions to the equation (U0−eiθ)u = 0

in B∗ as follows. We deﬁne the operator (cid:98)F (0)(θ) = ((cid:98)F (0)← (θ), (cid:98)F (0)→ (θ), (cid:98)F (0)↓ (θ), (cid:98)F (0)↑ (θ))

which is the Fourier transform of F (0)(θ) by

((cid:98)F (0)← (θ)f )(ξ2) = (cid:98)f←(θ, ξ2),
((cid:98)F (0)↓ (θ)f )(ξ1) = (cid:98)f↓(ξ1, θ),

((cid:98)F (0)→ (θ)f )(ξ2) = (cid:98)f←(−θ, ξ2),
((cid:98)F (0)↑ (θ)f )(ξ1) = (cid:98)f↑(ξ1,−θ),

for ξ = (ξ1, ξ2) ∈ T2. Here we have identiﬁed T2 with [−π, π)2.
Lemma 4.14. We have F (0)(θ)B = h(θ) and {u ∈ B∗ ; (U0 − eiθ)u = 0} =
F (0)(θ)∗h(θ).

Proof. We apply Theorem 4.13, taking X1 = B, X2 = h(θ) and T = F (0)(θ).
The relation F (0)(θ)B = h(θ) follows from the assertion (3) in view of Lemma 4.12.
For the proof of the latter part, we have only to show (u, f ) = 0 when u ∈ B∗,

f ∈ B, (U − eiθ)u = 0 and F (0)(θ)f = 0. Since(cid:98)u satisﬁes ((cid:98)U0(ξ) − eiθ)(cid:98)u(ξ) = 0, we
have supp(cid:98)u← ⊂ {ξ ∈ T2 ; x1 = θ}, supp(cid:98)u→ ⊂ {ξ ∈ T2 ; x1 = −θ}, supp(cid:98)u↓ ⊂ {ξ ∈
T2 ; x2 = θ} and supp(cid:98)u↑ ⊂ {ξ ∈ T2 ; x2 = −θ}. It follows

(cid:90)

(cid:16)(cid:98)u←(θ, ξ2)(cid:98)f←(θ, ξ2) +(cid:98)u→(−θ, ξ2)(cid:98)f→(−θ, ξ2)

Let us turn to the equation (U − eiθ)u = 0 in B∗.

(cid:3)

Theorem 4.15. We have F (+)(θ)B = h(θ) and {u ∈ B∗ ; (U − eiθ)u = 0} =
F (+)(θ)∗h(θ).

Proof. By using the resolvent equation (4.5), we have
(1 − R(θ + i0)∗V ∗)(1 + R0(θ + i0)∗V ∗)
= (1 + R0(θ + i0)∗V ∗)(1 − R(θ + i0)∗V ∗) = 1.

(4.15)

Then 1 − R(θ + i0)∗V ∗ is invertible. It follows that KerF (+)(θ)∗ = {0} and the
range of F (+)(θ)∗ is closed. Applying the assertion (3) of Theorem 4.13, we obtain
F (+)(θ)B = h(θ).
For the remaining part, we have only to prove {u ∈ B∗ ; (U − eiθ)u = 0} ⊂
F (+)(θ)∗h(θ). Suppose that u ∈ B∗ satisﬁes (U − eiθ)u = 0. We deﬁne u(0) ∈ B∗
by

(4.16)

u(0) = (1 + R0(θ + i0)∗V ∗)u

= u − eiθ(1 + eiθR0(θ − i0))V ∗u.

In view of U∗u = e−iθu and U0V ∗ = −V U∗, we have (U0 − eiθ)u(0) = 0. Lemma
4.14 implies u(0) = F (0)(θ)∗φ for some φ ∈ h(θ). Due to (4.16), we have (1+R0(θ +
i0)∗V ∗)u = F (0)(θ)∗φ. By using (4.15), we obtain

u = (1 − R(θ + i0)∗V ∗)F (0)(θ)∗φ = F (+)(θ)∗φ.

Then u ∈ RanF (+)(θ)∗.

4.5. Spectral decomposition of scattering operator. In view of Lemma 3.12,
we have only to show the absence of σsc(U ) in order to prove the absolute continuity
of σ(U ). It is well-known that Stone’s formula and the limiting absorption principle
of the resolvent operator imply the absolute continuity of the essential spectrum
of Schr¨odinger operators. An analogue of this argument holds for the dDQW as
follows.
Lemma 4.16. We have σsc(U ) = ∅.

Proof. Let θ ∈ (0, 2π) and I = (θ − , θ + ) for small  > 0. The lemma follows

from Lemma 4.4 and the formula (3.1) for U :

(EU ((θ − , θ(cid:48)))f, f )(cid:96)2 =

(4.17)
for θ(cid:48) ∈ I and f ∈ B. The proof is same as [15, Lemma 4.6].

The operators F (0) and F (±) are deﬁned by

(F (0)f )(θ) = F (0)(θ)f,

(F (±)f )(θ) = F (±)(θ)f,

for θ ∈ [0, 2π) and f ∈ B. The following lemma follows from the deﬁnition of
F (0)(θ).
Lemma 4.17. The following assertions holds.

(1) The operator F (0) can be extended uniquely to a unitary operator from (cid:96)2
0 f )(θ) = e−iθ(F (0)f )(θ)
(2) We have (F (0)U0f )(θ) = eiθ(F (0)f )(θ) and (F (0)U∗

for θ ∈ [0, 2π) and f ∈ (cid:96)2.

The operator F (±) also diagonalizes U as follows.

Lemma 4.18. The following assertions holds.

(1) The operator F (±) can be extended uniquely to a unitary operator from (cid:96)2
(2) We have (F (±)U f )(θ) = eiθ(F (±)f )(θ) and (F (±)U∗f )(θ) = e−iθ(F (±)f )(θ)

to H.
for θ ∈ [0, 2π) and f ∈ (cid:96)2.

Proof. Lemma 4.10 and the formula (4.17) imply

(EU ((θ1, θ2))f, g)(cid:96)2 =

(F (±)(θ)f,F (±)(θ)g)h(θ)dθ,

for θ1 < θ2, θ1, θ2 ∈ [0, 2π). It follows that F (±) is a partial isometry from Hac(U )
to H. In view of Corollary 3.12 and Lemma 4.16, we have Hp(U ) = Hsc(U ) = ∅.
Then we obtain the assertion (1).
The assertion (2) follows from the deﬁnition of F (±). The details of computation
(cid:3)

is same as [15, Theorem 4.7].

The Fourier transform of the scattering operator Σ = W ∗

+W− is deﬁned by

By the same way of [15, Theorem 5.3], we can see that (cid:98)Σ can be decomposed as
(cid:90) 2π
and (cid:98)Σ(θ) satisﬁes the following properties.
Theorem 4.19. Let θ ∈ [0, 2π). The S-matrix (cid:98)Σ(θ) satisﬁes the following asser-
(1) For f ∈ H, we have ((cid:98)Σf )(θ) =(cid:98)Σ(θ)f (θ).
(2) (cid:98)Σ(θ) is unitary on h(θ).
(3) We have (cid:98)Σ(θ) = 1 − 2πeiθA(θ) where

Remark. Usually the statement of the S-matrix holds for a.e. θ in the continuous
spectrum. For the case where σac(U0) has band gaps, the endpoints of σac(U0) are
the exceptional points. If U0 or U have some eigenvalues embedded in the contin-
uous spectrum, these embedded eigenvalues are also exceptional points. However,
the spectrum of the free QW U0 does not band gaps and its structure is uniform
on the unit circle. Indeed, there is no threshold in θ for the limiting absorption
principle (formulas (3.15) and (3.16), Lemmas 3.5 and 4.3, formulas (4.11) and
(4.12)) and the deﬁnition of the Hilbert space h(θ). Mathematically, the homo-
geneity of σac(U0) follows from ∂
∂ξj
assumption for C(x) and Corollary 3.12, there is no eigenvalue in the continuous

(e±iξj − eiθ)(cid:12)(cid:12)±ξj =θ (cid:54)= 0 for j = 1, 2. Due to the
spectrum. Thus the ﬁber operator (cid:98)Σ(θ) can be deﬁned for all θ modulo 2π without

thresholds. If we remove the second assumption for C(x), the operator U may have
some eigenvalues with eigenfunctions with ﬁnite supports. In this case, Theorem
4.19 holds for θ except for a ﬁnite number of embedded eigenvalues.

Due to the representation (4.14) of generalized eigenfunctions of U , we have for

u(+) = F (+)(θ)∗φ and u(0) = F (0)(θ)∗φ, φ ∈ h(θ),

In fact, v(+) satisﬁes (U0 − eiθ)v(+) = 0 in Z2 \ (D ∪ ∂D). Then we can see
these equalities by the same argument of the proof of Lemma 3.10, considering the
asymptotics (4.19).
For 2DQW, the scattered wave does not spread radially as above. Since V =
U − U0 is ﬁnite rank, the scattered wave for every chirality passes along corridors.
See Figure 3.
Theorem 4.20. Let φ ∈ h(θ).

(1) (A←(θ)φ)(x2) and (A→(θ)φ)(x2) vanish for |x2| ≥ n0 + 1.
(2) (A↓(θ)φ)(x1) and (A↑(θ)φ)(x1) vanish for |x1| ≥ n0 + 1.

As a consequence, A(θ) is an operator of ﬁnite rank.

v(+) = u(+) − u(0) = eiθ(cid:16)

eiθR0(θ − i0)g + V ∗u(0)(cid:17)

,

Proof. Note that

where g = V ∗u(0) − V R(θ − i0)V ∗u(0) for u(+) = F (+)(θ)∗φ and u(0) = F (0)(θ)∗φ,
φ ∈ h(θ). In view of the assumption for C(x), we have (V ∗u(0))←(x) = ((C∗ −
1)S−1u(0))←(x) = 0 for |x2| ≥ n0. Similarly, we have (V R(θ − i0)V ∗u(0))←(x) =
(S(C − 1)R(θ − i0)V ∗u(0))←(x) = 0 for |x2| ≥ n0. Thus the formula (3.16) shows

28

T. KOMATSU, N. KONNO, H. MORIOKA, AND E. SEGAWA

that v(+)(x) vanishes for |x2| ≥ 0. This implies that (A←(θ)φ)(x2) = 0 for |x2| ≥ 0.
The proofs for Ap(θ)φ with p ∈ {→,↓,↑} are similar.
