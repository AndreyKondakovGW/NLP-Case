POTENTIAL DENSITY OF PROJECTIVE VARIETIES HAVING AN

INT-AMPLIFIED ENDOMORPHISM

JIA JIA, TAKAHIRO SHIBATA, AND DE-QI ZHANG

Abstract. We consider the potential density of rational points on an algebraic variety

deﬁned over a number ﬁeld K, i.e., the property that the set of rational points of X becomes

Zariski dense after a ﬁnite ﬁeld extension of K. For a non-uniruled projective variety with

an int-ampliﬁed endomorphism, we show that it always satisﬁes potential density. When

a rationally connected variety admits an int-ampliﬁed endomorphism, we prove that there

exists some rational curve with a Zariski dense forward orbit, assuming the Zariski dense

orbit conjecture in lower dimensions. As an application, we prove the potential density

for projective varieties with int-ampliﬁed endomorphisms in dimension ≤ 3. We also study

the existence of densely many rational points with the maximal arithmetic degree over a

suﬃciently large number ﬁeld.

1. Introduction

Let K be a number ﬁeld with a ﬁxed algebraic closure K. Given a variety X over K, we

are interested in the set of K-rational points X(K) of X. More speciﬁcally, we study the

potential density of varieties over K.

Deﬁnition 1.1. A variety X deﬁned over a number ﬁeld K is said to satisfy potential
density if there is a ﬁnite ﬁeld extension K ⊆ L such that XL(L) is Zariski dense in XL,
where XL := X ×Spec K Spec L.

The potential density of varieties over number ﬁelds has been investigated in several papers.

The potential density problem is attractive because the potential density of a variety is

pretty much governed by its geometry. See [Cam04] for a conjecture characterising varieties

satisfying potential density. However, algebraic varieties for which the potential density is

veriﬁed are very few. See [Has03] for a survey of studies on the potential density problem.

In this paper, we ﬁrst study the potential density of varieties admitting int-ampliﬁed en-

domorphisms. For the deﬁnition of int-ampliﬁed endomorphisms, see 2.1(11). Recently, the

equivariant minimal model program for varieties with int-ampliﬁed endomorphisms was es-

tablished (cf. [MZ20]). It has been used to study arithmetic-dynamical problems (cf. [MY19],

[MMSZ20]). It turns out that the equivariant minimal model program is also useful for the

potential density problem.

Our main conjecture is the following.

Conjecture 1.2 (Potential density under int-ampliﬁed endomorphisms). Let X be a pro-

jective variety deﬁned over a number ﬁeld K. Suppose that X admits an int-ampliﬁed endo-

morphism. Then X satisﬁes potential density.

The endomorphism being int-ampliﬁed is a crucial assumption in Conjecture 1.2 above.
Indeed, consider X = X1 × C where X1 is any smooth projective variety and C is any
smooth projective curve of genus at least 2. Such X does not satisfy potential density

(cf. Remark 1.4(2)). It does not have any int-ampliﬁed endomorphisms either; this is because
every surjective endomorphism f of X, after iteration, has the form (x1, x2) 7→ (g(x1, x2), x2)
for some morphism g : X1 × C → X1 by [San20, Lemma 4.5], and hence descends to the
identity map idC on C via the natural projection X → C; thus, the iteration and hence f
itself are not int-ampliﬁed (cf. [Men20, Lemma 3.7 and Theorem 1.1]).

One might think that Conjecture 1.2 is too strong. In fact, the following even stronger

conjecture has already been long outstanding (cf. Medvedev–Scanlon [MS09, Conjecture

5.10], and Amerik–Bogomolov–Rovinsky [ABR11]).

Conjecture 1.3 (Zariski dense orbit conjecture). Let X be a variety deﬁned over an alge-

braically closed ﬁeld k of characteristic zero and f : X 99K X a dominant rational map. If
the f ∗-invariant function ﬁeld k(X)f is trivial, that is, k(X)f = k, then there exists some

POTENTIAL DENSITY

x ∈ X(k) whose (forward) f -orbit Of (x) := {f n(x) | n ≥ 0} is well-deﬁned (i.e., f is deﬁned
at f n(x) for any n ≥ 0) and Zariski dense in X.

Note that Conjecture 1.3 with f being int-ampliﬁed implies Conjecture 1.2 (cf. Lemmas 2.2

and 2.3).

Remark 1.4. We recall some known cases of the potential density problem and Conjec-

ture 1.3.

(1) Unirational varieties and abelian varieties over number ﬁelds satisfy potential density

(cf. [Has03, Corollary 3.3 and Proposition 4.2]).

(2) Let X be a variety with a dominant rational map X 99K C to a curve of genus ≥ 2

over a number ﬁeld. Then X does not satisfy potential density (cf. [Fal83] and [Has03,

Proposition 3.1]).

(3) Conjecture 1.3 holds for any pair (X, f ) with X being a curve (cf. [Ame11, Corollary

9]).

(4) Conjecture 1.3 holds for any pair (X, f ) with X being a projective surface and f a

surjective endomorphism of X (cf. [Xie19], [JXZ20]).

We ﬁrst prove Conjecture 1.2 for rationally connected varieties in dimension ≤ 3.

Proposition 1.5. Let X be a rationally connected projective variety over K. Suppose that
dim X ≤ 3 and X admits an int-ampliﬁed endomorphism. Then X satisﬁes potential density.

Conjecture 1.2 also has a positive answer for non-uniruled varieties in any dimension:

Proposition 1.6. Let X be a non-uniruled projective variety over K. Suppose that X admits

an int-ampliﬁed endomorphism. Then X satisﬁes potential density.

With the help of Propositions 1.5 and 1.6, we are able to show:

Theorem 1.7. Let X be a normal projective variety over K with at worst Q-factorial klt
singularities. Suppose that dim X ≤ 3 and X admits an int-ampliﬁed endomorphism. Then

X satisﬁes potential density.

In the last section, we study Question 1.9 below, which is also arithmetic in nature, initi-

ated in [KS14] and further studied in [SS20] and [SS21].

Deﬁnition 1.8 (cf. [SS20, Deﬁnition 1.4]). Let X be a projective variety over a number
ﬁeld K and f : X → X a surjective morphism. We recall the inequality

αf (x) ≤ d1(f )

4

JIA JIA, TAKAHIRO SHIBATA, AND DE-QI ZHANG

between the arithmetic degree αf (x) at a point x ∈ X(K) and the ﬁrst dynamical degree
d1(f ) of f (cf. 2.1(12) and (13)). Let L be an intermediate ﬁeld: K ⊆ L ⊆ K. We say that
(X, f ) has densely many L-rational points with the maximal arithmetic degree if there is a
subset S ⊆ X(L) satisfying the following conditions:

(1) S is Zariski dense in XL;
(2) the equality αf (x) = d1(f ) holds for all x ∈ S; and
(3) Of (x1) ∩ Of (x2) = ∅ for any pair of distinct points x1, x2 ∈ S.

Following [SS21], we introduce the following notation. We say that (X, f ) satisﬁes (DR)L
if (X, f ) has densely many L-rational points with the maximal arithmetic degree. We say
that (X, f ) satisﬁes (DR) if there is a ﬁnite ﬁeld extension K ⊆ L (⊆ K) such that (X, f )
satisﬁes (DR)L.

Question 1.9. Let X be a projective variety over K and f : X → X a surjective endomor-

phism. Assume that X satisﬁes potential density. Does (X, f ) satisfy (DR)?

Question 1.9 has a positive answer for smooth projective surfaces when d1(f ) > 1 (cf. [SS21,

Theorem 1.5]). We generalise it to (possibly singular) projective surfaces:

Theorem 1.10. Let X be a normal projective surface over K satisfying potential density,
and f : X → X a surjective morphism with d1(f ) > 1. Then (X, f ) satisﬁes (DR).

The following is an aﬃrmative answer to Question 1.9 for int-ampliﬁed endomorphisms

on rationally connected threefolds.

Theorem 1.11. Let X be a rationally connected smooth projective threefold over K and
f : X → X an int-ampliﬁed endomorphism. Then (X, f ) satisﬁes (DR).

2.1. Notation and Terminology

2. Preliminaries

(1) Let K be a number ﬁeld. We work over K when considering the potential density. We

ﬁx an algebraic closure K of K.

(2) Let k be an algebraically closed ﬁeld of characteristic zero. We work over k when

considering geometric properties.

(3) A variety means a geometrically integral separated scheme of ﬁnite type over a ﬁeld.

POTENTIAL DENSITY

(4) Let X be a variety over K and f : X → X a morphism (over K). We denote XK :=

X ×Spec K Spec K and fK : XK → XK the induced morphism (over K).

(5) The symbol ∼R denotes the R-linear equivalence on Cartier divisors.
(6) We refer to [KM98] for deﬁnitions of Q-factoriality and klt singularities.
(7) A variety X of dimension n is uniruled if there is a variety U of dimension n − 1 and a

dominant rational map P1 × U 99K X.

(8) Let X be a proper variety over a ﬁeld k. We say that X is rationally connected if there
is a family of proper algebraic curves U → Y whose geometric ﬁbres are irreducible
rational curves with cycle morphism U → X such that U ×Y U → X × X is dominant
(cf. [Kol96, IV Deﬁnition 3.2]). When k is algebraically closed of characteristic zero, if X

is rationally connected, then any two closed points of X are connected by an irreducible

rational curve over k (by applying [Kol96, IV Theorem 3.9] to a resolution of X). The

converse holds when k is also uncountable (cf. [Kol96, IV Proposition 3.6.2]).

(9) A normal projective variety X is said to be Q-abelian if there is a ﬁnite surjective
morphism π : A → X, which is étale in codimension 1, with A being an abelian variety.
(10) For a morphism f : X → X and a point x ∈ X, the forward f -orbit of x is the set

Of (x) := {x, f (x), f 2(x), . . .}. We denote the Zariski closure of Of (x) by Zf (x).

More generally, for a closed subset Y ⊆ X, we denote Of (Y ) := S∞

n=0 f n(Y ) and its

Zariski-closure Zf (Y ) := Of (Y ). We say that Of (Y ) is Zariski dense if Zf (Y ) = X.

(11) A surjective morphism f : X → X of a projective variety is called int-ampliﬁed if there
exists an ample Cartier divisor H on X such that f ∗H − H is ample. In particular,
polarised endomorphisms are int-ampliﬁed.

(12) Let X be a projective variety and f : X → X a surjective morphism. The ﬁrst dynamical

degree d1(f ) of f is the limit

d1(f ) := lim
n→∞

((f n)∗H · H dim X−1)1/n,

where H is an ample Cartier divisor on X. This limit always converges and is indepen-

dent of the choice of H.

(13) Let X be a projective variety over K and f : X → X a surjective morphism. Fix a
(logarithmic) height function hH ≥ 1 associated to an ample Cartier divisor H on X.
For x ∈ X(K), the arithmetic degree αf (x) of f at x is the limit

αf (x) := lim
n→∞

hH(f n(x))1/n.

This limit always converges and is independent of the choices of H and hH (cf. [KS16]).

Lemma 2.2. Let X be a projective variety over k and f : X → X an int-ampliﬁed endomor-
phism. Then k(X)f = k. In particular, if Conjecture 1.3 holds for (X, f ), then there exists
some x ∈ X(k) such that Of (x) is Zariski dense in X.

Proof. Assume to the contrary that there is a nonconstant rational function φ : X 99K P1 such
that φ◦f = φ. Let Γ be the graph of the rational map φ : X 99K P1 with projections π1 : Γ →
X being birational and π2 : Γ → P1 being surjective. Then f lifts to an endomorphism f |Γ
on Γ such that π1 ◦ f |Γ = f ◦ π1 and π2 ◦ f |Γ = π2. It follows from [Men20, Lemmas 3.4 and
3.5] that id : P1 → P1 is int-ampliﬁed, which is absurd.

(cid:3)

Lemma 2.3. Let X be a projective variety over K, f : X → X a surjective morphism,
and Z ⊆ X a subvariety which satisﬁes potential density (e.g., Z is an abelian variety or
unirational; see Remark 1.4(1)). If Of (Z) is Zariski dense, then X satisﬁes potential density.

Proof. Replacing K with a ﬁnite extension, we may assume that Z(K) is Zariski dense in Z.
Then the union S∞

n=0 f n(Z(K)) is a Zariski dense set of K-rational points of X.

(cid:3)

3. Rationally connected varieties: Proof of Proposition 1.5

Lemma 3.1. Let X be a rationally connected projective variety over k and of dimension
d ≥ 1, and f : X → X an int-ampliﬁed endomorphism. Assume Conjecture 1.3 in dimension
≤ d − 1. Then there is a rational curve C ⊆ X such that Of (C) is Zariski dense.

Proof. If we have a Zariski dense f -orbit Of (x), take any rational curve C passing through
x. Clearly, Of (C) is Zariski dense. So we may assume that f has no Zariski dense orbit.

Let x ∈ X(k) be a point such that Zf (x) is irreducible with dimension r < d. By
[Fak03, Theorem 5.1], the subset of X(k) consisting of f -periodic points is Zariski dense in
X. Pick an f -periodic point y ∈ X(k) \ Zf (x). After iterating f , we may assume that y is
an f -ﬁxed point. Take a rational curve C ⊆ X containing x and y. Set W := Zf (C). If
W = X, we are done. So we may assume that W ( X. If dim W = r, then W has its
irreducible decomposition as W = Zf (x) ∪ W1 ∪ · · · ∪ Wm. There is some n ≥ 0 such that
f n(x) ∈ Zf (x)\ Sm
i=1 Wi. Hence f n(C) ⊆ Zf (x). In
particular, y = f n(y) ∈ f n(C) ⊆ Zf (x), a contradiction. Thus r < dim W (< dim X = d).

i=1 Wi. Then f n(C) ⊆ W but f n(C) 6⊆ Sm

Now there exists an f -periodic irreducible component W ′ ⊆ W with r < dim W ′ < d.
Replacing f by a positive power, we may assume that W ′ is f -invariant. Then f |W ′ is an int-
ampliﬁed endomorphism on W ′ (cf. [Men20, Lemma 2.2]). By assumption, Conjecture 1.3
holds for (W ′, f |W ′). So there exists some w ∈ W ′(k) such that Zf (w) = Zf |W ′ (w) = W ′

POTENTIAL DENSITY

(cf. Lemma 2.2). In particular, Zf (w) is irreducible with dim Zf (w) > r. Continuing this
process, the lemma follows.
(cid:3)

Corollary 3.2. Let X be a rationally connected projective variety over k and of dimension
≤ 3, and f : X → X an int-ampliﬁed endomorphism. Then there is a rational curve C ⊆ X
such that Of (C) is Zariski dense.

Proof. This follows from Remark 1.4(3), (4), and Lemma 3.1.

(cid:3)

Proof of Proposition 1.5. By applying Corollary 3.2 to (XK, fK), we know that there is a
rational curve C ⊆ XK such that OfK (C) is Zariski dense. Replacing K with a ﬁnite
extension, we may assume that C is deﬁned over K. Then Of (C) is Zariski dense in X. The
theorem follows from Lemma 2.3.
(cid:3)

4. Int-amplified endomorphisms: Proofs of Proposition 1.6 and Theorem 1.7

Lemma 4.1. (cf. [Men20, Theorem 1.9]) Let X be a normal projective variety over k and
f : X → X an int-ampliﬁed endomorphism. Assume one of the following conditions.

(1) X is non-uniruled.
(2) X has at worst Q-factorial klt singularities, and KX is pseudo-eﬀective.

Then X is a Q-abelian variety. In particular, f has a Zariski dense orbit.

Proof. The ﬁrst claim is [Men20, Theorem 1.9]. Now there is a ﬁnite cover π : A → X (étale

in codimension 1) from an abelian variety A with f lifted to an int-ampliﬁed endomorphism

g on A (cf. [NZ10, Lemma 2.12] and [Men20, Lemma 3.5]). Since Conjecture 1.3 holds for
endomorphisms on abelian varieties (cf. [GS17]), g has a Zariski dense orbit Og(a) for some
a ∈ A(k) (cf. Lemma 2.2). Then Of (π(a)) is a Zariski dense orbit of f .
(cid:3)

Lemma 4.2. Let X be a normal projective variety over k and of dimension ≤ 3 with at
worst Q-factorial klt singularities. Let f : X → X be an int-ampliﬁed endomorphism. Then
there exists a rational subvariety Z ⊆ X of dimension ≥ 0, such that Of (Z) is Zariski dense.

Proof. By Remark 1.4(3), (4), and Lemma 2.2, the assertion holds when dim X ≤ 2. Then

by Corollary 3.2 and Lemma 4.1, we may assume that X is a threefold, which is uniruled
but not rationally connected, and KX is not pseudo-eﬀective.

By [MZ20], replacing f with an iteration, we can run an f -equivariant minimal model

program:

where each µi is a birational map and π is a Mori ﬁbre space with dim Y < dim X ′ = 3.
If dim Y = 0, then X ′ is klt Fano. Hence X ′ and X are rationally connected (cf. [Zha06,
Theorem 1]), contradicting our extra assumption. Thus dim Y = 1, 2. Since dim Y ≤ 2,
the int-ampliﬁed endomorphism g := f |Y has a Zariski dense orbit Og(y) by Remark 1.4
(3), (4) and Lemma 2.2 (cf. [Men20, Lemmas 3.4 and 3.5]). Replacing y by gN (y) for a
suitable N ≥ 0, we may assume that F := π−1(y) is a klt Fano variety of dimension equal
to dim X − dim Y ∈ {1, 2}, and hence a rational variety. Clearly, Of (F ) is Zariski dense in
X by construction.
(cid:3)

Proof of Proposition 1.6. Since being uniruled and the potential density are birational prop-

erties (cf. 2.1(7) and [Has03, Proposition 3.1]), they are invariant under the normalisation

map. Also, since an int-ampliﬁed endomorphism on the variety X lifts to an int-ampliﬁed

endomorphism on its normalisation (cf. [Men20, Lemma 3.5]), we may assume that X is

normal. Then the proposition follows from Lemmas 4.1 and 2.3.

Proof of Theorem 1.7. This follows from Lemmas 4.2 and 2.3.

5. The maximal arithmetic degree: Proofs of Theorems 1.10 and 1.11

In this section, we study Question 1.9. First, we prove Theorem 1.10.

Lemma 5.1. Let X, Y be normal projective varieties over K, and f : X → X and g : Y → Y
surjective endomorphisms. Assume that there is a surjective morphism π : X → Y such that
π ◦ f = g ◦ π. Then:

(1) If π is generically ﬁnite and (X, f ) satisﬁes (DR), then (Y, g) also satisﬁes (DR).

(2) If π is birational, then (X, f ) satisﬁes (DR) if and only if so does (Y, g).

π′

−→ X ′ ϕ

−→ Y be the Stein factorisation
Proof. Assume ﬁrst that π is generically ﬁnite. Let X
of π, where π′ is a projective morphism with connected ﬁbres (indeed, π′
OX ≃ OX ′) to a
∗
normal variety X ′, and ϕ is a ﬁnite morphism (cf. [Har77, Corollary 11.5]). Since π ◦ f =
g ◦ π and ϕ is ﬁnite, we see that π′ ◦ f contracts every ﬁbre of π′. By the rigidity lemma
(cf. [Deb01, Lemma 1.15]), there is a morphism f ′ : X ′ → X ′ such that π′ ◦ f = f ′ ◦ π′ and
ϕ ◦ f ′ = g ◦ π. By [SS21, Lemma 3.2], for (1), we only need to show that (X ′, f ′) satisﬁes
(DR), which can be deduced from (2); for (2), we only need to show that if (X, f ) satisﬁes

(DR), then so does (Y, g).

Let Σ ⊆ Y be the subset consisting of points y such that dim π−1(y) > 0, and E :=
π−1(Σ) ⊆ X, which is a closed proper subset. Since π has connected ﬁbres by Zariski’s Main

POTENTIAL DENSITY

Theorem (cf. [Har77, Corollary 11.4]), π|X\E : X \ E → Y \ Σ is an isomorphism. Since
g is ﬁnite, both Σ and Y \ Σ are g−1-invariant. There is an induced surjective morphism
f |X\E : X \ E → X \ E such that π|X\E ◦ f |X\E = g|Y \Σ ◦ π|X\E. Let L be a ﬁnite ﬁeld
extension of K such that (X, f ) satisﬁes (DR)L. Then there exists a sequence of L-rational
points SX = {xi}∞

i=1 ⊆ X(L) \ E such that

• SX is Zariski dense in XL;
• αf (xi) = d1(f ) for all i; and
• Of (xi) ∩ Of (xj) = ∅ for i 6= j.

Thus yi := π(xi) is well-deﬁned and SY := {yi}∞
i=1 satisﬁes the conditions of (DR)L for (Y, g);
note that d1(f ) = d1(g) and αf (xi) = αg(yi) (cf. [Sil17, Lemma 3.2] in the smooth case, or
[MMSZ20, Lemma 2.8] in general).
(cid:3)

We need the following from [SS20].

Lemma 5.2 (cf. [SS20, Theorem 4.1]). Let X be a projective variety over K and f : X → X
a surjective morphism with d1(f ) > 1. Assume the following condition:

(†)

There is a numerically non-zero nef R-Cartier divisor D on X such that
f ∗D ∼R d1(f )D, and for any proper closed subset Y ⊆ XK, there exists
a morphism g : P1

K) 6⊆ Y and g∗D is ample.

K → X such that g(P1

Then (X, f ) satisﬁes (DR)K.

We also need the following structure theorem of endomorphisms.

Proposition 5.3 (cf. [JXZ20, Theorem 1.1]). Let f : X → X be a non-isomorphic surjective

endomorphism of a normal projective surface over k. Then, replacing f with a positive power,

one of the following holds.

(i) ρ(X) = 2; there is a P1-ﬁbration X → C to a smooth projective curve of genus ≥ 1,

and f descends to an automorphism of ﬁnite order on the curve C.

(ii) f lifts to an endomorphism f |V on a smooth projective surface V via a generically

ﬁnite surjective morphism V → X.

(iii) X is a rational surface.

Proof. We use [JXZ20, Theorem 1.1]. Cases (1), (3) and (8) imply our (ii). Cases (4) ∼ (7)

and (9) lead to our (iii). Case (2) implies our (i), noting that f cannot be polarised since it

descends to an automorphism and hence ρ(X) = 2 by [MZ19, Theorem 5.4].

(cid:3)

10

JIA JIA, TAKAHIRO SHIBATA, AND DE-QI ZHANG

Proof of Theorem 1.10. When f is an automorphism, we may take an equivariant resolution

of (X, f ) and assume that X is smooth (cf. Lemma 5.1). In this case, the theorem follows

from [SS21, Theorem 1.5].

Now we assume that deg(f ) ≥ 2. We apply Proposition 5.3 to (XK, fK) (cf. [SS21, Lemma
3.3]). In either case, we may replace K with a ﬁnite ﬁeld extension so that the varieties and

morphisms are deﬁned over K.

In Case 5.3 (ii), the theorem follows from Lemma 5.1 and [SS21, Theorem 1.5]. In Case 5.3

(iii), the theorem is a consequence of [SS20, Theorem 1.11].

In Case 5.3 (i), we may assume g(C) = 1; otherwise, X does not satisfy potential density
(cf. Remark 1.4(2)). Let F ∼= P1 be a general ﬁbre of X → C. After replacing K with a
ﬁnite ﬁeld extension, there is a numerically non-zero nef R-Cartier divisor D on X such that
f ∗D ∼R d1(f )D (cf. [MMS+21, Theorem 6.4]). The numerical equivalence class of D is not
a multiple of that of the ﬁbre F since f ∗F ∼R F and d1(f ) > 1. Then (D · F ) > 0, by
the Hodge index theorem. Thus, (X, f ) satisﬁes the condition (†) in Lemma 5.2 and hence

satisﬁes (DR).

(cid:3)

Before proving Theorem 1.11, we need a stronger version of Corollary 3.2 in dimension 3.

Lemma 5.4. Let X be a rationally connected smooth projective threefold over k and f : X →

X an int-ampliﬁed endomorphism. Let D be a numerically non-zero nef R-Cartier divisor on
X. Then there is a rational curve C ⊆ X such that Of (C) is Zariski dense and (D · C) > 0.

Proof. By [Yos20, Corollary 1.4], X is of Fano type. Then there is a surjective morphism
φ : X → Y to a projective variety Y such that D ∼R φ∗H for some ample R-divisor on Y by
[BCHM10, Theorem 3.9.1].

If f has a Zariski dense orbit Of (x), then there is a rational curve passing through x (such
a curve exists since X is rationally connected) and satisfying the claims. So we may assume

that f has no Zariski dense orbit.

Since Conjecture 1.3 is known for surfaces (cf. [JXZ20, Theorem 1.9]), we can take a point
x0 ∈ X such that dim Zf (x0) = 2 (cf. Proof of Lemma 3.1). Replacing f by a power and
x0 by f N (x0) for some integer N ≥ 0, we may assume that Zf (x0) is irreducible. Take an
f -periodic point x1 ∈ X such that x1 6∈ Zf (x0) ∪ φ−1(φ(x0)). Take a rational curve C ⊆ X
containing x0, x1. We see that Of (C) is Zariski dense as in the proof of Lemma 3.1. Now
φ(C) is not a point by construction, so

(D · C) = (φ∗H · C) = (H · φ∗C) > 0.

POTENTIAL DENSITY

Thus C satisﬁes the claims.

Proof of Theorem 1.11. By [MMS+21, Theorem 6.4], replacing K by a ﬁnite extension, there
is a numerically non-zero nef R-Cartier divisor D on X such that f ∗D ∼R d1(f )D. Lemma 5.4
implies that, replacing K with a ﬁnite extension so that the curve C there (and f ) are deﬁned
over K, the pair (X, f ) satisﬁes (†) in Lemma 5.2. Hence (X, f ) satisﬁes (DR).
