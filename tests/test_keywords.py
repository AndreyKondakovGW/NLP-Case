text = '''We consider the potential density of rational points on an algebraic variety

defined over a number field K, i.e., the property that the set of rational points of X becomes

Zariski dense after a finite field extension of K. For a non-uniruled projective variety with

an int-amplified endomorphism, we show that it always satisfies potential density. When

a rationally connected variety admits an int-amplified endomorphism, we prove that there

exists some rational curve with a Zariski dense forward orbit, assuming the Zariski dense

orbit conjecture in lower dimensions. As an application, we prove the potential density

for projective varieties with int-amplified endomorphisms in dimension â‰¤ 3. We also study

the existence of densely many rational points with the maximal arithmetic degree over a

sufficiently large number field.'''
