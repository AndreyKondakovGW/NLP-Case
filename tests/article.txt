Story highlights Don't be fooled by the word "energy"Some energy bars contain as much saturated fat as a Snickers bar(CNN) Energy bars are a convenient source of nutrition and come in a wide variety of flavors to satisfy different palates.
But, like many foods in a specific category, not all energy bars are created equal.
For example, some bars covered in chocolate contain as much saturated fat as a Snickers bar; others contain almost as much sugar.
Energy bars containing mostly fruit and nuts can serve as satisfying snacks.
In general, try to aim for bars with less than 3 grams of saturated fat and at least 4 grams of fiber.
